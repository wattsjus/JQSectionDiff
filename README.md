# JQSectionDiff
Using jQuery to find what has changed in the input fields of a section of the DOM.  This plugin allows you to use elements to create sections that have their own onchange, onfocus, on blur events.  The onchange event will show you all the values serialized as a JSON object and also what has changes since the last time the section had focus.
